Hello, I am Chanwoo Lim, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I am particularly interested in backend development, focusing on designing the core structure of software and managing data flow. Through various projects, I am continuously improving my skills.

I find technical challenges such as database design, API development, and server optimization fascinating. My goal is to provide stable and efficient services to users. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am learning various backend-related technologies, including Python, Java, SQL, and applying them in real-world projects.

I aspire to become a backend developer who continuously learns and grows within the rapidly evolving IT environment, delivering better solutions.

Thank you.
