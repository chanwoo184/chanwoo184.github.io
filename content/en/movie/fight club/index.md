The film is based on the novel of the same name by American author Chuck Palahniuk and was directed by David Fincher in 1999.

Starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, with Jared Leto in a supporting role, *Fight Club* garnered anticipation as Fincherâ€™s follow-up to *Seven*. However, it didn't receive the expected acclaim upon its release. Today, it is considered one of Fincher's most iconic works. The film was nominated for the Best Sound Editing Award at the 72nd Academy Awards.
