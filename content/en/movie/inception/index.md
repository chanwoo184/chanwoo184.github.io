In 2001, director Nolan, inspired by the concept of lucid dreaming, submitted a pitch for a horror film about "dream thieves" to Warner Bros. However, feeling the need to gain more experience in large-scale filmmaking, he temporarily shelved *Inception* and went on to make *Batman Begins* (2005), *The Prestige* (2006), and *The Dark Knight* (2008). The script for *Inception* was purchased in February 2009. Filming began in Tokyo on June 19, 2009, and concluded in Canada on November 22, 2009, spanning six countries and four continents. The production officially spent $160 million through Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures.

The film premiered in London on July 8, 2010, and was released in IMAX and conventional theaters worldwide on July 16, 2010. It became a box office success, grossing over $800 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films in recent years. DVD sales reached $680 million. The film received widespread critical acclaim for its originality, casting, sound, and visual effects, and won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects.
